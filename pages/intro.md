# FullStack

## Intro
People most often asked, why Full Stack? Before that, we need to know what, is Full Stack. Does Full Stack build the Front-end? Yes. Does Full Stack build the Back-end? Also yes. So, he/she handled everything? Pretty much, yes. Full Stack can be describe as someone who build an app/web, from start to finish. In a simple manner, it can be describe like that.

So, again, why Full Stack? It's not necessarily we need to be a Full Stack, but rather, along the way, we'll get our hands dirty in other stuffs too, that maybe not related to our field. Knowing other stuffs is also great in some ways.

## CLI Overview
As mentioned in previous week, when we talk about REPL, we also talked about CLI. Command Line Interface is, in short, the box where we type in command, and resulting in another action, either it's just printing into the Terminal, or even executing actions based on our input, REPL. Basically, it's the one that run the *shell*

## Shells
Like what has been mentioned on previous weeks summary. Shells, in REPL is the one that responsible in actually executing those commands we typed in our terminal.
