# Security

## Why
Simple. An unauthorized access to your server can left you sad for weeks. Imagine an unauth access of a user and they wiped out all the data you have? Or lock you out, from your own servers? Or even steal those private data? 

This is why, security matters. It doesn't matter if you code like God, or super fast or anything. As long as there are no security involved in it, it will be meaningless.

## Security Checklist
There are some main points
1. SSH
2. Firewalls
3. Update
4. 2FA
5. VPN

You know that instead of using email-password combination, we can always use SSH where it combine Private Key and Public Key. Therefore, even though there man in the middle, the data that pass through, will be meaningless

Same for Update. Often, there are vulnarable found, and with a package (let's say that the vuln found on an npm package), if this package happen to be used by many people, this will be harmful for many people. The fix usually came out within the newer version, which is why updates is very, very important.

Two-Factor Auth and VPN is another thing. 2FA involved another step that required users, to let's say, input an OTP code that sent, via mobile phone text, or email for example. While VPN offers a safe (due to you are basically using another network, which affecting your address, thus hiding your information. Sometimes company offers more security like encrypted data, etc)
