# Get to Know the Internet

## The Internet
We use it every day, we use it all the time. But what is the Internet? We can say that the internet is the place where devices connected to each other. Either it's a bunch of requests and responses, packages, and others, in the end though, it's a system of globally interconnected devices. 

## IP Address and Protocols
What is IP Address? As what it's name suggested, it is an address for devices. Just like how computer can only process commands in binary, this is how computer addressed in the internet. 

But what is protocols? As we explained earlier in the previous section, the internet is basically device connected to another device. So how do they communicate? This is where protocols came in. Protocols is like the standard on communication, whether it is a communication that needs direct response from the target or even the one that keep spitting out data over and over again. The examples of protocols are, HTTP, TCP, UDP.

## DNS
DNS stands for Domain Name System. Maybe the most easy example is `google.com`. We all probably heard of this before. This is what domain is. Where `google.com` is the domain, the `.com` is the TLD or Top Level Domain (owned by companies. So when we create new domain, let's say, `hahahihi.com`, we pay +-$0.6 for the `.com`). And cases for, let's say `maps.google.com` is a sub-domain. We can think that subdomain is like a bedroom, in a house, where the `google.com`, is the house. 

But back to Domain Name System. DNS is the way of maps these readable address to IP Addresses.

## Packets
Packets, is a bunch of data that transmitted throughout the internet. We can think of packet, is like an envelope, while the data is the letter. It contains the source, destination, and the data itself.

## Net Neutrality
So, for recap. The internet works based on trust system. With how devices communicate in mind (via protocols), we send our letter, or in this case the packet. And we know that it will get to its destination.

But here comes the politics. Of course we know about the ISP, or Internet Service Provider. These guys here, let's say, we want to send a packet to, Australia(?), then the ISP came, and "Yeah, we can cover that, but you know, we can get that packet faster if you pay as a certain amount of money~".

This is the debate came from about Net Neutrality, whether an ISP should be just a pipe, that sends it, or it can interfere and do things that has been mentioned above.
